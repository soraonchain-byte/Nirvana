# Nirvana Protocol — Security Review (Week 7)

**Program:** `FxPnV48rg9KkK6huUimjcjL9H4xssM8n7j3uva8k9tmc` (devnet)
**Scope:** `programs/nirvana/src/lib.rs` — `create_stream`, `withdraw`, `cancel`, `trigger_milestone`, `top_up`, `release_vault`
**Framework:** Anchor 0.31.1
**Reviewer:** Riko Kurnia Sandi
**Method:** Manual code review against the [coral-xyz/sealevel-attacks](https://github.com/coral-xyz/sealevel-attacks) catalog + integration/edge/adversarial tests (`tests/nirvana.ts`, `tests/nirvana-edge-security.ts`).

**Verdict: No critical or high-severity issues remaining.** All vesting funds are gated by signer + PDA + arithmetic checks that are exercised by the test suite (37/37 passing).

## Checklist

### 1. Signer authority verified on every instruction ✅

| Instruction | Who must sign | Enforced by | Test |
|---|---|---|---|
| `create_stream` | `authority` (funder, also payer) | `Signer` + `init` payer | every create test |
| `withdraw` | `recipient` only | `has_one = recipient` + state PDA seeds bind recipient | `Task 3: Unauthorized withdrawal must fail` |
| `cancel` | `authority` only | `has_one = authority` + `close = authority` | `should fail for unauthorized user to cancel` |
| `top_up` | `authority` only | `has_one = authority` | `security: only the authority can top_up` |
| `trigger_milestone` | `authority` **or** designated `arbiter` | explicit `require!(is_authority || is_arbiter)`; `arbiter == Pubkey::default()` is rejected | `arbiter can trigger` / `reject unrelated signer` |
| `release_vault` | `authority` | `Signer`; PDA re-derived from authority+recipient | see Finding F3 |

An unauthorized signer also changes the derived state-PDA seeds, so Anchor rejects on `ConstraintSeeds`/`ConstraintHasOne` before the instruction body runs. Verified by the unauthorized-withdraw, unauthorized-cancel, and unauthorized-top_up tests.

### 2. PDA seeds are unique & canonical ✅

- State PDA: `["state", authority, recipient, nonce.to_le_bytes()]` — the `nonce` (added in the Week 6 fix) guarantees the same (authority, recipient) pair can hold unlimited independent streams with **no collision**.
- Vault PDA: `["vault", state]` — bound to its parent state.
- Canonical bump is stored (`state.bump`) and reused via `bump = distribution_state.bump` on every subsequent instruction, preventing bump-seed substitution.
- **Test:** `security: two concurrent streams to the SAME recipient (nonce uniqueness)` creates two streams for one pair, asserts distinct state+vault PDAs, and confirms cancelling one leaves the other live.

### 3. No integer overflow / underflow ✅

- Every arithmetic op uses `checked_add` / `checked_sub` / `checked_mul` / `checked_div`, returning `NirvanaError::MathOverflow` on failure.
- Linear-vesting math casts to `u128` before multiplying (`base_amount as u128 * elapsed`) then divides, so the intermediate product cannot overflow `u64`.
- Division-by-zero is guarded by `total_duration > 0`.
- **Test:** `edge: create_stream rejects amounts that overflow u64 (MathOverflow)` passes `u64::MAX + u64::MAX` and asserts the deposit total is rejected before any token transfer.

### 4. Account ownership & type validation ✅

- Accounts are typed via Anchor's `#[account]` / `Account<TokenAccount>` / `Account<Mint>`, so Anchor verifies the owning program and discriminator (defends against "type cosplay").
- Token accounts are constrained: `recipient_token_account.mint == distribution_state.token_mint`, `authority_token_account.owner == authority`.
- **Test:** `security: withdraw with a wrong-mint token account is rejected` proves the mint constraint blocks settling into a foreign-mint account.

### 5. Arbitrary CPI / token-program substitution ✅

- All token movement goes through `token::transfer` / `token::close_account` with `token_program: Program<Token>`, so a fake token program cannot be substituted.
- The vault's transfer authority is the state PDA, signed via `CpiContext::new_with_signer` with the canonical seeds + stored bump — only the program can move vault funds.

### 6. Account closing / revival ✅

- `cancel` uses Anchor's `close = authority`, which zeroes the account, reassigns it to the System Program, and drains lamports — the standard safe-close, immune to the "closed-account revival" attack.
- The vault SPL account is explicitly `token::close_account`-d during cancel, returning rent to the authority.
- **Test:** `Task 4: Cancel ... verify account closure` and `edge: cancel just before end ...` confirm the state account is unreachable after cancel.

### 7. Reentrancy ✅ (N/A by platform)

- Solana executes instructions single-threaded with no synchronous callback into the program mid-CPI, so classic reentrancy does not apply.
- Defensive ordering is still correct: `withdraw` updates `claimed_amount` in the same instruction as the transfer, so a repeated call within a transaction cannot double-claim.
- **Test:** `edge: double withdraw does not double-spend` withdraws a fully-vested stream twice; the second call returns `NothingToWithdraw` and the balance is unchanged.

## Findings & Fixes

| # | Severity | Finding | Resolution |
|---|---|---|---|
| **F1** | Medium (tests) | After the Week 6 nonce upgrade, `tests/nirvana.ts` still called `create_stream` with the old 7-arg signature and derived the state PDA with 3 seeds (no nonce). The entire suite failed to run against the deployed program. | Fixed the `getPDAs`/`createStream` helpers to pass the `nonce` arg and seed the PDA with `nonce.to_le_bytes()`. All 29 existing tests now pass. |
| **F2** | Low (tests) | The "trigger milestone after expiry" test asserted on the error **code** `StreamExpired`, but the client surfaced the human-readable `#[msg]` `"Stream expired."`, so the assertion was brittle. Contract behavior was correct. | Relaxed the matcher to `/StreamExpired\|Stream expired/i`. |
| **F3** | Informational | `release_vault` derives `state_signer` with **legacy** seeds `["state", authority, recipient]` (no nonce) and only runs when that account is empty (`StreamStillActive` otherwise). For nonce-era streams this branch is effectively unreachable — it exists solely to sweep orphaned vaults left by streams cancelled before the vault-closing upgrade. | Documented as intentional migration tooling. It cannot touch a live (nonce-seeded) stream, and `cancel` now closes vaults, so no new orphans are produced. |
| **F4** | Informational | Linear vesting uses integer division and rounds down, leaving sub-token "dust" mid-stream. | Not exploitable: the remainder is never lost — it settles to the recipient at full vest, or splits correctly to recipient/authority on `cancel`. Tested by the full-withdraw and cancel-split tests. |
| **F5** | Low (tooling) | On Node ≥ 23 the native TypeScript loader runs the `.ts` tests as ESM, breaking CommonJS named imports from `@coral-xyz/anchor`. | Test scripts in `package.json` and `Anchor.toml` now set `NODE_OPTIONS=--no-experimental-strip-types` so ts-node compiles to CommonJS. |
